# Personal Development and Team Leadership

Prof: PRIOR Andrew

## Abstract

This course consists of three essential elements:

- 'Know yourself' - understanding the drivers of your behavior. This is the basis of any personal development and is critical for developing effective interaction with others whether as a team member or as a team leader.
- 'Working with others' - building on the self-knowledge mentioned above, this core element allows you to explore, understand, and practice ways of working with others that are both more enjoyable and more effective. This is critical given that almost everyone works as part of a team.
- 'What's next?' - building on both the above sections, this element helps you take the next steps in your career: setting objectives, selecting target organizations, applying for jobs, and effective interviewing.

`Teaching and Learning Methods:` Lectures, team exercises, and presentations.

`Course Policies:` On-time class attendance is mandatory; three unapproved absences mean exclusion.

This is one of a triad of related courses all of which are of special interest to those intending to become managers (practically everyone!), or, eventually, owners of their own companies.

`Teaching and Learning Methods:` Lectures, team exercises and presentations

`Course Policies:` On-time class attendance is mandatory; three unapproved absences mean exclusion.
