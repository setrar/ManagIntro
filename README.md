# Introduction to management

## Abstract

This course is like a mini-MBA (Master' in Business Administration) and covers much of the same ground as a business school classical post-experience MBA (though not in the same depth). This is one of a triad of related courses all of which are of special interest to those intending to become managers (practically everyone!), or, eventually, owners of their own companies.

`Teaching and Learning Methods:` Lectures, team exercises and presentations

`Course Policies:` On-time class attendance is mandatory; three unapproved absences mean exclusion.
